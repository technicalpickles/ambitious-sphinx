An Ambitious Sphinx Adapter
===========================

Ever want to do some sexy full text searching?

How about finding all tweets that have "Obama" in the any of its attributes?

Tweet.select { "Obama" }

What about tweets with "McCain" and "Clinton"?

Tweet.select { "McCain" && "Clinton" }

"Edwards" or "Huckabee" ?

Tweet.select { "Edwards" || "Huckabee" }


### Big honking disclaimer



### Getting Started

You will need the following gems to use ambitious-sphinx:

  gem install ambition
  gem install ultrasphinx
  

  Now install it as ambitious-sphinx:

    sudo rake install
    
  Require our files somewhere, like at the end of config/environment.rb
  
    require 'ambition/adapters/ambitious_sphinx'
    
  You will also need to go through the motions of setting up ultrasphinx. This includes setting up sphinx itself, and modifying your model to indicate what's to be indexed, and so on.

### Playing with the code base

In addition to the other dependencies, you'll need:

  gem install echoe redgreen mocha test-spec
  
Run the tests with:
  
  rake test
