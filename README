An Ambitious Sphinx Adapter
===========================

I don't know about you, but I like me some sexy full-text searching.

Want to find all meals that mention bacon?

  Meal.select {'bacon'}

What about bacon bits and sour cream?

  Meal.select {'bacon bits' && 'sour cream'}

Maybe with bacon in the name, or cheese in the recipe?

  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' || m.recipe =~ 'cheese'}

Cheese in the name, but not grilled?

  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' && m.name !~ 'grilled'}
  

### Big honking disclaimer

We're still learning a lot about how sphinx and ambition work, so things are likely to change a lot.

### Getting Started

You will need the following gems to use ambitious-sphinx:

  gem install ambition
  gem install ultrasphinx
  

  Now install it as ambitious-sphinx:

    sudo rake install
    
  Require our files somewhere, like at the end of config/environment.rb
  
    require 'ambition/adapters/ambitious_sphinx'
    
  You will also need to go through the motions of setting up ultrasphinx. This includes setting up sphinx itself, and modifying your model to indicate what's to be indexed, and so on.

### Playing with the code base

In addition to the other dependencies, you'll need:

  gem install echoe redgreen mocha test-spec
  
Run the tests with:
  
  rake test
