= An Ambitious Sphinx Adapter

I don't know about you, but I like me some sexy full-text searching.

Want to find all meals that mention bacon?

  Meal.select {'bacon'}

What about bacon bits and sour cream?

  Meal.select {'bacon bits' && 'sour cream'}

Maybe with bacon in the name, or cheese in the recipe?

  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' || m.recipe =~ 'cheese'}

Cheese in the name, but not grilled?

  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' && m.name !~ 'grilled'}
  

== Big honking disclaimer

We're still learning a lot about how sphinx and ambition work, so things are likely to change a lot, and features are likely to be missing.

== Getting Started


=== Dependencies

You will need the following gems to use ambitious-sphinx:

  gem install ambition
  gem install ultrasphinx

=== Our stuff

We don't have a gem yet, so presumably you'll do a clone of our git repo. Then you need to install it:


  sudo rake install
  
=== Add it to your app
    
Require our files somewhere, like at the end of config/environment.rb, maybe create config/initializers/sphinx.rb

  require 'ultrasphinx'
  require 'ambition/adapters/ambitious_sphinx'
  
=== Sphinx and Ultrasphinx
    
You will also need to go through the motions of setting up ultrasphinx.

This includes:

 * Configuring/installing sphinx
 * Modifying your model to indicate what's to be indexed
 * Bootstrapping ultrasphinx
 
All this is discussed in detail in ultrasphinx's README

== Playing with the code base

In addition to the other dependencies, you'll need to:

  gem install echoe redgreen mocha test-spec
  
Run the tests with:
  
  rake test
